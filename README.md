# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation solution

This is a solution to the [Intro section with dropdown navigation challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Although it wasn't requested, I added display for tablets in addition to desktop and phone.
Being used to using React JS, I did this challenge to review the Javascript Vanilla language.
